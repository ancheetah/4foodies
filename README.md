# Portfolio Project Proposal
### By Kadeja Cordova & AJ Ancheta


## Introduction

4Foodies is a food blog that offers recipes and cooking classes. 4Foodies’ goal is to inspire people to get in the kitchen and become confident chefs. Recipes range from beginner to advanced, so individuals from all cooking levels can learn to cook better. On the website recipes and photos are posted, along with step by step instructions. 4foodies also provides virtual or in-person cooking classes that guests can register and pay for.

The goal is to design a website using a minimalist black and white theme with a clean, simple layout and minimal text to draw attention to colorful food photography. The masonry-style homepage draws the eye around by combining quotes, images, and text in a random fashion. The website should be intuitive to use for a website visitor.



### List of Features

* A header with the blog name/logo only on the homepage (becomes sticky-top navbar on other pages)
* Horizontal navbar (aligned right) with navbar brand on left collapses to hamburger icon for smaller screens: 
    * About, Recipes, Contact
    * Button for Events
* Should indicate which page is active
* Font awesome icons for categories and social media icons
* Standard footer with nav links, social media, and contact info (telephone/email)


### Home Page

* A Bootstrap alert or jumbotron with a dynamic countdown to the next event date and a button linking to the events page

* A unique masonry style grid with a random assortment of the latest recipe cards, inspirational quotes, upcoming events
* Full-width categories carousel for each recipe category: chicken, beef, pork, fish, breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert (we can start with just three categories for now until we learn about carousels in class)
* Each category will be represented by a circle cutout image and caption below that when hovered over shows an icon
* Categories will be clickable buttons but will all link to recipe page for now
